# CSSBattle
CSSBattle is an online website where developers can practice their CSS/HTML skills and learn. Here is the link to the website https://cssbattle.dev/

This repository contains my solutions to some of the challenges I found interesting. While these may not always be the most optimized solutions, they are based on a logical approach. (I'll improve them over time).

Feel free to use my code and build upon it in your own solutions! ðŸ˜Š
